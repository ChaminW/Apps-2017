Innovative, amazing with simple interface app to measure anything you want!

To make it work you need to have OpenCV Manager installed first. In case of its lack the user will be redirected under proper link at Google Play.

Whatâ€™s more you need something as a benchmark. You can use your ones or some others predefined.
